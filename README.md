# ðŸ¥· React Ninja Blog

A basic blog website built with React â€” part of the [Net Ninja React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d).  
This project helped me build intuition around routing, state, components, and React hooks.

## âœ¨ Features

- React Router DOM (`<Route>`, dynamic routes, `useParams`)
- Custom data fetching with a custom `useFetch` hook
- Blog list rendering with delete buttons
- Page navigation with clean layout
- Basic blog creation form (with title/body/author)
- Error handling and loading states
